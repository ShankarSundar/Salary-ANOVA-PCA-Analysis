# 📈 Salary Analysis & PCA on College Admissions Data

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes two case studies using advanced statistical techniques:
- **Salary Analysis** using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- **College Admissions Data** using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

The objective is to draw inferences on factors affecting salaries and identify key patterns in college admissions by reducing dimensionality.
